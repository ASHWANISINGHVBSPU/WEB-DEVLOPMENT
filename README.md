## Introduction

This project demonstrates the MERN stack, a popular technology stack for building full-stack web applications. It combines four technologies:

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-project.git
